months it includes did you can preferred digital preferred stars stream picks service with tv dogs last internet c b the unlimited primary line you were also adding the following equipment and services internet voice equipment to rental for thirteen dollars per monthyou may maybe come along and they normally are thinking okay lets i i i dont know okay so youre calling to implement a german so im into i went on the places you know not an explosive any kind of like you dont think the case because im going to look in a week or a month long of seventy eight medical person a person nothing nothingso forty ninety nine its basically um the base rate of your internet and streaming and right amber um the twelve month it would be it would be action e it would be a great it would change from forty nine ninety nine to fifty nine ninety nine so we just have to add ten dollars on top of that so the regular rate will only be apply right after since the promotion is good for twelve months um on the eighth month from forty nine ninety nine it would be fifty nine ninety nine and right after the eighteen months thats where the regular rates apply that would be seventy nine eighty fiveand by the way sure that is amounted too let me go ahead and double check um that is amounted to a hundred and fifty four dollars and ninety nine plus fifty cent taxes a hundred and fifty four dollars and ninety nine cents a month four and that includes that will include um actually oh channels and also stars and show time and thats ityeah so your boxes other one making your account high i think if you get back pocket of one fifty nine ninety nine mhm that would have a better value because you dont have to pay for the dvr safe with aaa and you have the premiums okay so i will get it at you on cinemax then youre not off all all the uh all the china okaylook at eleven just to keep you in the middle of winter uh when its all over a hundred at the end that going out to you okay youre okay with his political at least to connect today and your legal putting political area okayforty seven ninety uh what its going to give you is um that particular package ah actually has two hundred plus channels on it but its got some of my favorite channels because its got things like i like smithsonian and history and things like that um the on court movie channels the older movies and stuff there in their uh their happened to be in this package uh and then if i add the see the hd is included with that so that i can drop that h t v youre only paying ten dollars for your dvr green ticks you know yeahsee now you can do the performance internet be with the package that i offered to you without upgrading your internet um itll be sixty two ninety nine a month left a fifty two sixty two because otherwise youll be looking at two ninety five yes if you go lower performance internet itll be at twoum i mean i havent done the order yet i just clicked it um so ill be fifty nine ninety nine for the package you get your choice of stars or show time and then the secondary box you have its six ninety nine currently right now but because youre downgrading to just basic cable with this plan that secondary box would go to free youd be looking at your sixty nine ninety nine plus tax  and that would comes to let me seethirty five ninety nine week and then you do pay extra to have hd and those sorts thing so what im doing is unbundling it all together bringing that package pricing down to the ninety four ninety nine where it does bring the monthly bill down to one forty six seventeen after the government taxes and everything mhm and and the seasonal planand uh this bond the packages normally build that array of um one hundred fifty nine dollars ninety nine cent before any additional equipment or taxes are added uh but you have this uh package at a rate of one hundred four dollars uh ninety nine cent mainly because uh you had opted in uh to a twenty four months uh promotional do uh back in uh september of two thousand seventeen uh i mean its due to mature on september uh twenty third of two thousand nineteen which is this year um so as of right now i dont have a solution for uh reducing a monthly recurring chargesmatch them resign and i found it for them is on for forty nine ninety nine and they they probably matched it alright want want backgroundand not only that bye they told me that that package or whatever that offer initially what the forty nine ninety nine offer last because i you know i dont want to we you know were in a temporary housing i cannot do with two year agreement you know the the pricing of that went up to sixty nine ninety nine last taxes and all that all together plus the gig and all thatbut advantis it will go back on and once its fully registers then we will check again if you will be getting uh enough signal okay almost done here its already at sixty person okay okayand if you cant do that and if while can do it for ninety five im a full not to take it so so that doesnt include your taxes as hes on the account on your additional equipment the ninety five and then keep in mind you are going to a slower internet speed and also with while you dont have your on demand available for you and i did see here that you guys are using the on demand quite a bit um so you dont have your on demand available for you would go into the while servicesthis is by this it was toward the second its about nineteen  i mean a hundred and twenty five ninety nine a month thats how much man i got to be a month um i can jerry that its one ninety four sixteen man\n"

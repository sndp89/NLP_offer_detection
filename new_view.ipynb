would have to go to Id have to upgrade night my package to include that but it was going to jump off Um I believe it was seventeen dollars a month by adding them That would be the only way to do that is to purchase all the sports CHANNELS to be able to receive them  Ill be I could not get on iLl be by myself Um Okay so I didnt Okay I I seen a while back  <br><br>VIDEO3<br>So I called in and they told me the only way to get NFL to upgrade for the next package which would include all the sports channels And I used to have all the sports tennis and I lived in Chicago Well other sports CHANNELS are all recorded and its just comes on a different kinds of the day for whatever ship  I think somebody is working for just twenty four seven There we start and I thought Why would I want to see ESPN and ESPN too all day long with the harder you know what I want to see  <br><br>HSD4<br>Its usually like $#one eighty nine#$ Um and I know we run the early bird special but we dont have that available as of yet usually comes out the the closer to the time so usually late March early April Alright So the only option is a longer F and theyLL be NETWORK right now  Yeah because of the extra innings Um its not available yet  <br><br>VIDEO5<br>But thats the ESPN one into that is what repetitious I dont want that And thats what they told me I would have to do is get all the sports CHANNELS I said  Well once you see so much its all the petitions I dont want to watch it again  <br><br>VIDEO6<br>Um so if you wanted to add on the sports and entertainment package you can also um added on through um your your cable box Oh Plus when I uh that when you go if you go to the CHANNEL and it says you must subscribe to it either added or call your local local provider or something like that  Okay What

the same thing And I said they will just forget it then  But I never extended my contract I I I have no reason to fire  <br><br>HSD11<br>So I dont understand why you wh whatever you check says that youll adjust it for me I never requested to send it All I did was moved and accepted the new MODEM that they said it was better then what I have because of the Internet  Thats all the only change I ever did And I got that modem here when I moved not at my old address that came up when I moved after after June or very in the month of June twenty eighteen  <br><br>HSD12<br>All I did was moved and accepted the new modem that they said it was better then what I have because of the Internet Thats all the only change I ever did And I got that MODEM here when I moved not at my old address that came up when I moved after after June or very in the month of June twenty eighteen  So it seems like by accepting that modem Thats what extending my contract  <br><br>HSD13<br>Kind of like a two year agreement starting from June two thousand eighteen Do you show When you when you sent me that new MODEM for the Internet  Hm Thats a whole different phone number  <br><br>HSD14<br>Because I had left

card to know But if you wanted to add something that requires you to change your package then Yes  \\n\\nVIDEO2\\nI was told before by your company that if I wanted to include them theyLL be I would have to go to Id have to upgrade night my package to include that but it was going to jump off Um I believe it was seventeen dollars a month by adding them That would be the only way to do that is to purchase all the sports CHANNELS to be able to receive them  Ill be I could not get on iLl be by myself Um Okay so I didnt Okay I I seen a while back  \\n\\nVIDEO3\\nSo I called in and they told me the only way to get NFL to upgrade for the next package which would include all the sports channels And I used to have all the sports tennis and I lived in Chicago Well other sports CHANNELS are all recorded and its just comes on a different kinds of the day for whatever ship  I think somebody is working for just twenty four seven There we start and I thought Why would I want to see ESPN and ESPN too all day long with the harder you know what I want to see  \\n\\nHSD4\\nIts usually like $#one eighty nine#$ Um and I know we run the early bird special but we dont have that available as of yet usually comes out the the closer to the time so usually late March early April Alright So the only option is a longer F and theyLL be NETWORK right now  Yeah because of the extra innings Um its not available yet  \\n\\nVIDEO5\\nBut thats the ESPN one into that is what repetitious I dont want that And thats what they told me I would have to do is get all the sports CHANNELS I said  Well once you see so much its all the petitions I dont want to watch it again  \\n\\nVIDEO6\\nUm so if you wanted to add on the sports and entertainment package you can also um added on through um your your cable box Oh Plus when I uh that when you go if you go to the CHANNEL and it says you must subscribe to it either added or call your local local provider or something like that  Okay What time are you on right now Ah Im not on anything right now  \\n\\nVIDEO7\\nUh if you go to the because theyre selling the spring training its still be earlier that not to cry Shes described Paul or add to your package Okay What CHANNEL is that  What What time are you watching that on Yeah well I took it off  \\n\\nVIDEO8\\nI mean I I dont want to extend my my passage yet So you see what channel Uh they wont give me the CHANNEL or device  Thoughts are on Okay  \\n\\nVIDEO9\\nOkay And uh I have Id have to look see what CHANNEL the White Sox are on  Um so is that the one thats nine eighty nine ten ninety nine ya Event um per month for per month  \\n\\nVIDEO10\\nI would have to pay extra to me It wasnt worth watching It wasnt me work having seven four CHANNELS when they also the same thing And I said they will just forget it then  But I never extended my contract I I I have no reason to fire  \\n\\nHSD11\\nSo I dont understand why you wh whatever you check says that youll adjust it for me I never requested to send it All I did was moved and accepted the new MODEM that they said it was better then what I have because of the Internet  Thats all the only change I ever did And I got that modem here when I moved not at my old address that came up when I moved after after June or very in the month of June twenty eighteen  \\n\\nHSD12\\nAll I did was moved and accepted the new modem that they said it was better then what I have because of the Internet Thats all the only change I ever did And I got that MODEM here when I moved not at my old address that came up when I moved after after June or very in the month of June twenty eighteen  So it seems like by accepting that modem Thats what extending my contract  \\n\\nHSD13\\nKind of like a two year agreement starting from June two thousand eighteen Do you show When you when you sent me that new MODEM for the Internet  Hm Thats a whole different phone number  \\n\\nHSD14\\nBecause I had left for a while And thats about right I dont know when it shows the MODEM was issued to me or when you receive the new one  The old one No I I I took it over and back to the to the regular company here in Fort Wayne  \\n\\nXM15\\nI said Okay So when they finally were able to come out here I remember it was a choose do that I I had to be here when they had to run you LINES to connect to the power BOX for Comcast this out here because um this house was

\\n\\nHSD4\\nThen weLL test it again Okay And then um just so we can get a SPEED test on file  Could you also run a speed test over at speed test dot extended t dot com Okay I can get to do Sure because its its back working there because the stocks are still okay  \\n\\nHSD5\\nOkay And then um just so we can get a speed test on file Could you also run a SPEED test over at SPEED test dot extended t dot com  Okay I can get to do Sure because its its back working there because the stocks are still okay The try Ill try this again  \\n\\nHSD6\\nOkay Im cancelling Its a SPEED test dot d dot com  Okay I guess Steve test dog at  \\n\\nHSD7\\nOkay Testing And its P start test Well if for some reason that um youre not achieving the INTERNET speeds that youre paying for um could be that

the reason why you have cable is to get the CHANNELS you want so I can go over some different options with you  Do you mind though if I verify some additional information from you Katherine if thats okay so I can pull up your account Okay  \\n\\nVIDEO2\\nAnd um I see that youve already verified your social security number and phone number through the automated system so we dont have to go through that again And I see that you recently just started with us so definitely a learning progress You know we didnt know what CHANNELS can with what  What channels are you missing that you would like Um we would like to order like movies  \\n\\nVIDEO3\\nOkay um I know that h Will isnt free Its fifteen dollars Um but the good thing with the more the more um movie CHANNELS that you order like say if you do three  I know its three four thirty dollars So if you add more you get more of a discount with the premium channels  \\n\\nVIDEO4\\nI do want to kind of add some more Theres like a like there like another package And I can upgrade too that have a least a little bit more CHANNELS and what we have now  Yeah theyre actually is um so right now youre on their actual We have a preferred package  \\n\\nVIDEO5\\nIt would be $#1 seventy six fifty eight#$ a month Um and that would be for the three services in the additional cable channels You would get additional um kids channels too and then make some more sports CHANNELS and regular channels  Okay And just a question because my bill is already like $#a hundred and eighty five dollars#$ a month

       "18  10035262901550951617  18     \\n\\nVIDEO1\\nWell that in my contract Um not unless um okay so it depends If you wanted to add um like a movie CHANNEL like HBO  Something thats um like you can add on make all the card to know But if you wanted to add something that requires you to change your package then Yes  \\n\\nVIDEO2\\nI was told before by your company that if I wanted to include them theyLL be I would have to go to Id have to upgrade night my package to include that but it was going to jump off Um I believe it was seventeen dollars a month by adding them That would be the only way to do that is to purchase all the sports CHANNELS to be able to receive them  Ill be I could not get on iLl be by myself Um Okay so I didnt Okay I I seen a while back  \\n\\nVIDEO3\\nSo I called in and they told me the only way to get NFL to upgrade for the next package which would include all the sports channels And I used to have all the sports tennis and I lived in Chicago Well other sports CHANNELS are all recorded and its just comes on a different kinds of the day for whatever ship  I think somebody is working for just twenty four seven There we start and I thought Why would I want to see ESPN and ESPN too all day long with the harder you know what I want to see  \\n\\nHSD4\\nIts usually like $#one eighty nine#$ Um and I know we run the early bird special but we dont have that available as of yet usually comes out the the closer to the time so usually late March early April Alright So the only option is a longer F and theyLL be NETWORK right now  Yeah because of the extra innings Um its not available yet  \\n\\nVIDEO5\\nBut thats the ESPN one into that is what repetitious I dont want that And thats what they told me I would have to do is get all the sports CHANNELS I said  Well once you see so much its all the petitions I dont want to watch it again  \\n\\nVIDEO6\\nUm so if you wanted to add on the sports and entertainment package you can also um added on through um your your cable box Oh Plus when I uh that when you go if you go to the CHANNEL and it says you must subscribe to it either added or call your local local provider or something like that  Okay What time are you on right now Ah Im not on anything right now  \\n\\nVIDEO7\\nUh if you go to the because theyre selling the spring training its still be earlier that not to cry Shes described Paul or add to your package Okay What CHANNEL is that  What What time are you watching that on Yeah well I took it off  \\n\\nVIDEO8\\nI mean I I dont want to extend my my passage yet So you see what channel Uh they wont give me the CHANNEL or device  Thoughts are on Okay  \\n\\nVIDEO9\\nOkay And uh I have Id have to look see what CHANNEL the White Sox are on  Um so is that the one thats nine eighty nine ten ninety nine ya Event um per month for per month  \\n\\nVIDEO10\\nI would have to pay extra to me It wasnt worth watching It wasnt me work having seven four CHANNELS when they also the same thing And I said they will just forget it then  But I never extended my contract I I I have no reason to fire  \\n\\nHSD11\\nSo I dont understand why you wh whatever you check says that youll adjust it for me I never requested to send it All I did was moved and accepted the new MODEM that they said it was better then what I have because of the Internet  Thats all the only change I ever did And I got that modem here when I moved not at my old address that came up when I moved after after June or very in the month of June twenty eighteen  \\n\\nHSD12\\nAll I did was moved and accepted the new modem that they said it was better then what I have because of the Internet Thats all the only change I ever did And I got that MODEM here when I moved not at my old address that came up when I moved after after June or very in the month of June twenty eighteen  So it seems like by accepting that modem Thats what extending my contract  \\n\\nHSD13\\nKind of like a two year agreement starting from June two thousand eighteen Do you show When you when you sent me that new MODEM for the Internet  Hm Thats a whole different phone number  \\n\\nHSD14\\nBecause I had left for a while And thats about right I dont know when it shows the MODEM was issued to me or when you receive the new one  The old one No I I I took it over and back to the to the regular company here in Fort Wayne  \\n\\nXM15\\nI said Okay So when they finally were able to come out here I remember it was a choose do that I I had to be here when they had to run you LINES to connect to the power BOX for Comcast this out here because um this house was uh was uh a foreclosure  And it was empty for many years before I found it I didnt terminate  \\n\\nVIDEO16\\nSo if we do change you from the fine that youre on theres no going back So there are four particular channels however that we are working on a contract with So we dont have access to those CHANNELS right now  Which is we TV up W D in America and ID  \\n\\nVIDEO17\\nI never picked that like the another thing I didnt Um I used to have it but uh again all that a lot A lot of his entertainment And there was a like four CHANNELS of music  Mhm Im a music that I just always listen to  \\n\\nVIDEO18\\nMhm Im a music that I just always listen to Um And one day I was going into my CHANNELS and I ended up  They added like ten They did something to the big change all the channel networks I guess they lost them and gain some  \\n\\nVIDEO19\\nUm And one day I was going into my channels and I ended up They added like ten They did something to the big change all the CHANNEL networks I guess they lost them and gain some  Next thing I knew I had uh ten extra channels of the total team and I thought Wow but I never ordered that like you know package it Just title that And then they offer me HBO  \\n\\nVIDEO20\\nThey added like ten They did something to the big change all the channel networks I guess they lost them and gain some Next thing I knew I had uh ten extra CHANNELS of the total team and I thought Wow but I never ordered that like you know package it  Just title that And then they offer me HBO I mean uh say boy and the guy says but playboy would be in Spanish  \\n\\nVIDEO21\\nYeah Yeah And the four CHANNELS that I mentioned now so I wanted to let you know to the difference  Okay so its going to be um its so basically if you wanted to change we can But it does start us under a new contract because this is for two years so we are removing and then putting under a new fun  \\n\\nHSD22\\nOkay so its going to be um its so basically if you wanted to change we can But it does start us under a new contract because this is for two years so we are removing and then putting under a new fun And now the MLB NETWORK is different from the MLB pass okay  Okay The the l no be that you have on TV right now  \\n\\nVIDEO23\\nThats uh in market games or out of market gains Thats the market So thats whatever the CHANNEL picks up okay  And to keep what I have right now At one  \\n\\nHSD24\\nThirty five seventy four I will get the MLB YouLL get the MLB NETWORK is only nothing else  No You got all the sports channels
